 #LJ Code 201 - Day 1

 ##Today started off slow, as with any weird 1st day.  Once we started diving into the coding, things started getting more interesting.  Although, the conversations today were quite entertaining.  It was nice getting to meet new people and hear about the differences in everyone's experiences.  It also caught me off guard today when I noticed that the majority of the students in class, as well as the instructor and TAs, were using MACs instead of PCs.  This was a bit backwards from what I was expecting.

 ##There was an issue with getting the Git-Bash command "open filename.html" to work on PCs.  It is supposed to open the file in the default browser.  Apparently, PCs require a different command: "start" instead of "open".
