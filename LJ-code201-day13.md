#LJ Code 201 - Day 13

##Today I was partnered with Darcy to work on configuring local storage persistence in our projects.  We were running into issues for a while because, for some reason, the JSON.stringify was not working as it should have.  Once Aliza came to assist, it mysteriously started working.  After that, it was smooth sailing since we had the framework already in place.  All it took was a couple extra lines of code.  The persistence was verified on both of our projects and all good to go.

##I also helped Darcy to get her chart working properly.  There were a few issues that she was struggling with, so we got things ironed out.  All is well now.
