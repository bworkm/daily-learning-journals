#LJ Code 201 - Day 15

##Got the bus mall project submitted with final edits.  There are plenty of things that I would like to get added to this and plenty of other stuff that I would like to clean up, but given that this is a stepping stone on the road to 301, I am happy with its' current state.  

##I am really looking forward to our final project of Battleship.  There is a lot of potential with this game and I am really excited to get it started.  The instructor and team are all anxious to see how we tackle this as well.  Not exactly looking forward to the presentation, but I know that our team will knock this out of the park.
