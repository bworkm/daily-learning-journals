#LJ Code 201 - Day 10

##CSS is getting to be a pain.  Arranging the block items in the correct way is, at times, causing more problems than not.  I am working on understanding when to use which 'position' and 'display' options.  So far, this is my biggest issue, but I know that it will cause me more problems going forward.

##Because of the CSS issues, I have not fully completed my Salmon Cookie project or the wireframe exercise.  I will be working with others more next week to get a better understanding.
