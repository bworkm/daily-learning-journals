 #LJ Code 201 - Day 3

 ##For some reason, nesting two loops caused more of a problem than I anticipated.  I have done this before, but still had a heck of a time getting it to work.  I understand iterating through each loop, but breaking out of both loops when a specific condition was met is where the problem occurred.  To resolve the issue, I realized that I was not correctly breaking the outer loop.  Whew!

 ##Tomorrow we will be allowed to use functions which is going to help clean up our code tremendously.
