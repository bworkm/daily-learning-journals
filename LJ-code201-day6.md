#LJ Code 201 - Day 6

##Today we began working with the DOM (Document Object Model).  Some of its' features I am already familiar with, but plenty others are new.  Last week I had integrated 'document.getElementById' into my about_me page.  This week we expanded on this to create objects, albeit without constructors, for storing cookie sales information about cookie stores at several locations.  Looking forward to using constructors tomorrow to get this done more efficiently.
