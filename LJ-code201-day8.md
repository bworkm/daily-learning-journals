#LJ Code 201 - Day 8

##The last two days have been very interesting.  I have built several objects using object literal notation as well as constructor functions.  As I am expanding on this weeks' project I am finding more and more areas to optimize my code.  I would like to create several more functions to encompass the creation of the tables.  There are several times I'm using the same code over and over again.  

##The rest of the week will leave time for me to work on cleaning everything up.  Hopefully I can focus a bit more in the coming days so I don't get sidetracked like I did today.  Although, I was able to help another student with some of his objects.  He has an idea of what he's doing, but it's obvious that he doesn't quite understand it all yet.  He is making progress though.
